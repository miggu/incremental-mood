Original project launched 2014

/// Project route

I've manageed to create a real data API flow, where you'd get the current and most recent ask value for a QUOTE, but in order to get real time data I'd have to subscribe which is someghing I'd do if the project would get serious.

Need to create a way or randomising deltas

Also ideally I would like to work with modules

Not because of any performance related issues but more for code maintanability
